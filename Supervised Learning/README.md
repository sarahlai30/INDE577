Supervised learning is the use of labeled data sets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. The concepts I will cover in this section are the Perceptron,
Gradient Descent, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision/Regression Trees, and Ensemble Learning.
