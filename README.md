# Fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository is a compilation of the coursework completed throughout the **Data Science and Machine Learning** course. The course introduced a wide range of essential data science and machine learning techniques, using tools like **scikit-learn**, **Keras**, and **TensorFlow 2**.

## Course Topics
The main topics covered in this repository include:
- **Supervised Learning**: Model Building and Error Analysis, Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors,
  Decision/ Regression Trees, and Ensemble Learning.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: k-Means Clustering and Principle Component Analysis

## Repository Structure
The repository includes the following directories and files:
- **/data/**: Contains all datasets used for this project.
- **/notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with code implementations for each topic.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and overview.

## Course Objectives
This collection showcases my progress in implementing and understanding fundamental machine learning techniques and tools across various topics and data types.

## Acknowledgments
Thank you to my professor, Randy Davila, and classmates for valuable guidance and feedback throughout the course.
